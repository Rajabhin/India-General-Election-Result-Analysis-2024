# India-General-Election-Result-Analysis-2024

#Designed and implemented a relational database system to analyze the 2024 India General Election results using SQL.
Performed ETL processes on multiple CSV datasets,applied advanced SQL techniques for state-wise and alliance-wise seat analysis,
and generated insights into voting trends, winning margins, and candidate performance.

#Key Contributions:

Designed database schema and ERD to structure election data across states, constituencies, parties, candidates, and results.

Executed ETL pipeline to extract, clean, transform, and load 5 CSV datasets into normalized relational tables.

Applied advanced SQL joins, subqueries, and window functions to derive insights such as state-wise seat share, alliance dominance, and winning candidates.

Created calculated fields to dynamically map parties under alliances (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., OTHER).

Generated reports on top 10 candidates by EVM votes, constituency-level winners and runners-up, and alliance performance across states.

Optimized queries with indexing and query tuning to efficiently handle large datasets.

Conducted state-level case study (Maharashtra) covering seats, candidates, parties, total votes (EVM & postal), and voting patterns.

Strengthened expertise in SQL-based data analysis, data modeling, and performance optimization for real-world analytics projects.
